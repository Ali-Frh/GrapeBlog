# GrapeBlog üçá
a Simple Static Blog Generator

## WTF Is This ?
GrapeBlog is a simple static blog generator, thats it! \
im always interested in writing blog posts, but also i have concerns about keeping it as free as possible, \
in the other hand i find github pages a great opportunity for static backend-less web pages to share their knowledge without any concern.\
and for this goal, i find a project named Jekyll which i find it very complicated and even not compatible with RTL Languages, so long story short i wanted to make a Jekyll alternative with less complexity without ruby-crap and stuff.

## Project State:
under construction ...
