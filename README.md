a Simple Static Blog Generator


## WTF Is This ?
GrapeBlog is a simple static blog generator, thats it! \
Im always interested in writing blog posts, but also i have concerns about keeping it as free as possible, \
In the other hand i find github pages a great opportunity for static backend-less web pages to share their knowledge without any concern.\
and for this goal, i found a project named Jekyll which i find it very complicated and even not compatible with RTL Languages, so long story short i wanted to make a Jekyll alternative with less complexity without ruby-crap and stuff.

## Key Features:
### Performance ⚡
nothing is faster than vanilla HTML and CSS!
### Security 🛡️ 
no backend = no vulnerability
### Easy to Use 👌 
Just write your Post and Build it.
### Supports different Themes 🖼️
### Comment System 💬         
Who says static websites can't have comment system ?!

## Project State:
under construction ...

## Project Goals:
☐ Cross Platform Support \
☐ Design Another Themes \
☐ Add Useful Comments \
☐ Choose Proper Licence \
☐ Candy-ass Terminal Responses \
☐ Make Wiki and Theming Guide 


## Thanks To:
- Jekyll Project for inspiration 
- Cusdis Project for Comment Section
